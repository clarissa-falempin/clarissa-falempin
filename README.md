- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clarissa-falempin
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applied omics-based research, and currently am working in a academic-based setting. I would be interesting in further developping multi-omics integration pipelines.  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply rMATS applied in a Linux environment. My current project allows me to dive deeper into splice variant analysis as well as developping an R/Shiny based tool. 
- ğŸ“« I can be reached through my Linkedin page: www.linkedin.com/in/clarissa-falempin-73a195237
- I am always open to feedback and questions!
